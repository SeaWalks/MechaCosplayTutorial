# Introduction

Welcome! This tutorial will walk a beginner through building a **con-able, badass, hall-stopping Gundam Cosplay**. Disclaimer- I am not the greatest cosplayer in the world. Everyone has their own “ninja way,” and many are more experienced than me. It’s always best to **learn from as many people and places as you can**. Much of the information here can also be easily adapted to any armor-based cosplay, not just Gundams.

## About Me

I’m Eric! You can find me on Instagram at [@EricCraftworks](https://instagram.com/Eric.Craftworks).  
I’ve been building Gundam cosplays for over a decade and am the most prolific Gundam cosplayer in the US, with over a dozen Gundam builds under my belt. I specialize in EVA foam builds that balance aesthetics and practicality.


## Before You Start

Building a Gundam/Mecha cosplay is no easy task. Here are a couple of things you must think about before diving in. 

### Time

- Everyone works at their own pace with different amounts of free time each week to dedicate to cosplay. I would allocate **7 months to a year** to complete a build. 
- For reference, I’ve spent **many hundreds of hours** on my builds.  
- It is almost always better to delay a build than rush it and be unhappy with the result.

### Cost

- I would budget roughly **$400–$500 in materials**, plus ~$100 in tools if starting from scratch. While the total amount can vary wildly, thats the rough ballpark for a standard sized gundam build. While this is a lot, you won't need it all up front.  
- Costs are often backloaded into **painting and finishing**; Plastidip is an absolute killer.

| Category | Estimated Cost |
|----------|----------------|
| EVA Foam, 5 rolls | $140 | 
| Cement, 3 pt | $30–50 | |
| Strapping+Buckles | $30 | 
| PVC Pipes/Fittings | $20 |
| Spray Paint x8 | $90–110 | 
| Plasti Dip x6  | $60 | |
| Misc consumables | $80 |
| **Total** | **$450–490** | 
</details>


### Handlers

You WILL need a “handler” — a friend (or two, or three) to help you survive the convention. This is a huge ask- these people will be chained to you, and you will suffer and die without them. 
They can help with:  

- Suiting up  
- Drinking water  
- Navigating the convention safely  
- Checking for damage / doing spot repairs  
- Manging your con badge
- And a million other things that I take for granted

>**Tip:** If you can find a handler that is a cosplayer/cosplay adjacent, that would help a ton as they would be better equipped to do things like spot repairs and check for damage.

### Physical Demands

- Wearing a Gundam cosplay can be tiring, uncomfortable, or honestly straight up painful. It can be hot, heavy, hard to see in and annoying to move in. Make sure you are physically (and mentally!) equipped to face these challenges. 
>This varies wildly on the suit design; Thunderbolt Gundam nearly broke me, while Build Burning was a stroll through a rose garden.  
- This tutorial emphasizes wearability whenever possible, but the laws of physics cannot be escaped. 

### Mental Demands

- Building a Gundam cosplay ~~can be~~ is mentally taxing. You will labor for hundreds of hours. A good portion of those won't nessecarily be fun. You will need to be highly motivated and be willing to trudge through the greatest of slogs. If you feel like you might flake out- maybe chose a smaller project, or give yourself more time to take a break and fall back in love with the idea of building something awesome. 
> Don't forget- we're all in this together. Misery loves company, after all. 

### Transportation

- You need to **safely transport your suit**.  
- Most sedans can fit an average Gundam cosplay- crazier designs (big guns, big backpacks) might have to be transported in larger vehicles.
- Size varies by design, so always check beforehand.
