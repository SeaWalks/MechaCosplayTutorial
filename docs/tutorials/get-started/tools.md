# Tools

Essential tools for building mecha (or really any) EVA foam cosplay.

## Essential Tools

### Exacto Knife
A sharp, precise cutting tool essential for detailed work on EVA foam.

### Dremel/Rotary Tool
Once you have this, every problem looks like a dremel-shaped nail. The ability to swap out attachments means it can do anything from grinding down foam bevels to cutting metal stock. My #1 use of this tool is for cutting in EVA foam bevels with a sanding wheel and cleaning up seams/fuzzies with a grinding stone.

### Ruler
Highly recommend having a ruler with a transparent grid, to make squaring up perpendicular lines a breeze. It also helps if you need to offset a line by a specific amount.

### White Gel Pens
The best way to write on black EVA foam.

- **Recommendation:** Sakura Gelly Roll White (Whatever cheap white gel pen will do the trick)

### Blue Ball Point
The cheap way to write on black EVA foam - harder to see, but is almost free. It also doesn't bleed through paint layers unlike some other ball point pen colors.

- **Recommendation:** The cheapest big box of blue Bics you can find.

### PVC Pipe Cutter
Makes cutting pipes quick and easy. Not "mandatory" - you could get away with using a cutoff wheel for a dremel. However, if you can swing it, it definitely makes life easier.

- **Recommendation:** Whatever you can get cheaply at home depot - these all seem to work the same.

### Duct Tape
A good, "in case of emergencies" patch to do quick repairs at the convention. You can hold together seams, or even create some strapping in a pinch. Recommend getting a roll of white and black.
