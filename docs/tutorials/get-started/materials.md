## EVA Foam
- EVA vs 3d printing: I’ve only ever built primarily out of cardboard and EVA foam, so I don’t know a ton about cosplay-scale 3d printing. There are two reasons that I would recommend using EVA foam for Gundam builds. 
    Lightness- EVA foam parts can be absurdly light- my GQux beam rifle was less than 1Lb. A 3d printed version would most likely be many times that. Every shaved pound will make your experience much much more enjoyable, and could make the difference between a miserable trip back to the car in the afternoon and comfortably enjoying the whole day at the convention. 

    - Lightness also comes into play when it comes to parts supporting themselves- a large 3d printed backpack with wings would be much more likely to sag and crack under its own weight as opposed to something made with eva foam, where if its boxed out may as well be infinitely big and still stable and lightweight. If you’re familiar with the [square cube law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law), you’ll know what i’m talking about. 
    
    - Flexibility- When you push your suits as hard as I do, bumping into things (or things bumping into you) is an inevitability. Having parts flex instead of snap or shatter is invaluable, particuklarly around the feet.
- Types of EVA Foam: Here is the TLDR: you are looking for large rolls (48”x70”) of double sided (so clean on both sides) foam. That way you don’t have the issue of having a pattern too big for your foam. Without a big deep dive, you generally want L400/4LB eva foam. 

Disclaimer, I'm no chemist or expert. The the stuff I use, XPLE (Cross linked poly ethylene), foam seems to be used interchangeably with EVA foam in some places. Different cosplay focused websites will sell their own branded foam, which blend different densities/hardness. I would generally advise not buying these because 1) The sheets are often too small for our purposes and 2) They are mightily expensive. If you want to splurge, go for it- I hear great things, and the cosplayers they sponsor are absolute monsters. But for our purposes, our big cheap rolls work excellent. 

The best place I have found to purchase EVA Foam online is [here](https://www.foambymail.com/product/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-4lb.html). There are multiple variations- I find that the 4lb works great as an all rounder, and is most likely the equivalent to “L400” foams, wheres the 6LB is “L600”, etc etc. The 2LB is floppier and lighter, the 6LB is stiffer and heavier. I highly suggest buying enough to get free shipping for even better value- this beats out FoamMart for us California locals. 


# Adhesives
 - Contact Cement: This is the #1 adhesive for EVA Foam. Incredibly strong, flexible bond. When done properly, the foam itself will tear before the glue joint. Two options here: Barge Cement, and Weldwood Contact cement (In the red can). In my experience, they perform the same, with weldwood being a good bit cheaper. The most cost efficient route would be to buy a gallon of the weldwood from walmart and pour it out as needed into smaller, airtight squeeze bottles. I typically buy a pint at the time, and it lasts me quite a while, with an average build taking around 3 jars of glue. Two big things about this stuff: it is toxic, so use it in a well ventilated area ideally with a respirator. Second- it goes gummier and harder to work with as it oxidizes so try to keep contact with the air to a minimum.
> Recommendation: Weldwood Contact Cement, in the red can. Recommend buying in Pints or Quarts- the smaller sizes lose too much value, and the gallons sizes force you to decant glue into smaller vessels which could be a pain. 
- Hot Glue: The cosplayer’s best friend. If you can use contact cement, use cement instead- it is much stronger. Hot glue is great for reinforcing seams from the back, gluing non-foam things to foam, or really anything to any other thing quickly and easily. It comes in two sizes- mini and large. In my experience, the more the merrier. 
> Recommendation: The cheapest, biggest box of the stuff you can find on Amazon. 
- Two part Epoxy: The strongest adhesive in our arsenal. Rarely used, but when you need it nothing else will do. A pain to work with, but if you need to glue mission critical stuff (anything involving shoes) this is the way. I’ll usually keep a tube of this stuff in the toolbox and treat it as a one time use. 
> Recommendation: Whatever you find at the store- these all more or less seem to work the same in my experience. 
- E6000: A step behind in strength compared to a two part epoxy, but a good deal more flexible. Great for locking down straps (although if you know how to sew, that would probably be better). More of a nice to have than an essential. 
> Recommendation: Medium sized tube on Amazon should last you forever.
- Superglue: Great for quick fixes at the con, but during construction I rarely use this stuff. Great for gluing on small greeblies, but wouldn’t count on it holding anything stronger- just do the right thing and use contact cement instead. 
> Recommendation: A pack of a bunch of tubes/nozzles; if a tube goes bad, you’ll have a lot, lot more.
